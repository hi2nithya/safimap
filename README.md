# safimap
This is the interactive map we used in our demonstration. It is a modified version of the open source code by OpenLayers. The two files in this repository are the only two files we modified. This is what we used: https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/geographic.html and https://openlayers.org/en/latest/doc/tutorials/bundle.html
